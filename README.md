# Statement

This is a project for promoting the creation of a scientific organization, hereafter referred to as the _Institute_, that will pursue the systematic study of suffering as the specific subject-matter of a comprehensive theoretical and practical discipline. 

An informal group of promoters is being formed. Eventually, it will necessarily include at least one very wealthy sponsor. Then, promoters will give way to a founding board that will take care of future action, deciding when, where and how to create the _Institute_. 

In the first few years, it is envisioned that the board of directors (sponsor, chief executive, counselors...) will hire a few professional persons for doing administrative tasks (management, marketing...) and "preliminary" research tasks such as bibliographic database, resource repertories, terminology, classification (taxology), measurement and mapping of suffering, R&D planning, etc. Also, a number of persons will be hired as independent contractors to give their advice within a consultative body. Those persons will be chosen among those already studying suffering as a topic in particular, and other specialists who deal with closely relevant matters, be it in health sciences, psychology, sociology, Buddhism, effective altruism, the United Nations system, animal welfare, etc.
