Statement
This is a project for promoting the creation of a scientific organization, hereafter referred to as the Institute, that will pursue the systematic study of suffering as the specific subject-matter of a comprehensive theoretical and practical discipline. 

An informal group of promoters is being formed. Eventually, it will necessarily include at least one very wealthy sponsor. Then, promoters will give way to a founding board that will take care of future action, deciding when, where and how to create the Institute. 

In the first few years, it is envisioned that the board of directors (sponsor, chief executive, counselors...) will hire a few professional persons for doing administrative tasks (management, marketing...) and "preliminary" research tasks such as bibliographic database, resource repertories, terminology, classification (taxology), measurement and mapping of suffering, R&D planning, etc. Also, a number of persons will be hired as independent contractors to give their advice within a consultative body. Those persons will be chosen among those already studying suffering as a topic in particular, and other specialists who deal with closely relevant matters, be it in health sciences, psychology, sociology, Buddhism, effective altruism, the United Nations system, animal welfare, etc.

As a basic policy, the Institute will foster the science of suffering in a spirit of objectivity while making sure not to run counter, by itself or in its relations with others, to its officially declared “ethical priority: the alleviation of suffering in the world”. (this formulation might have to be reworded... perhaps a precaution principle has to be included in the Institute’s code of conduct, rather than declaring an ethical stance that is beyond ‘objectivity’ and that suppose that all suffering has to be ‘alleviated’...)

Why?



Suffering is arguably, by some aspects, the most awful phenomenon in our world. However, even if a “science of suffering” is often mentioned, it appears that no central place exists in our culture where one can find a well-managed body of theoretical and practical knowledge about suffering as such, its various kinds, its numerous causes, its degrees of prevalence or urgency, its currently proposed remedies and how to use them, the people and organizations concerned with those matters, etc.

Why should we promote this project?
Because we value the alleviation of excessive suffering, scientific knowledge, and technical mastery. 
Because we hope that an initiative like this can constitute a game-changing advance, an important world first, a historic breakthrough.
Because the needs are immense in this field, they constitute an economic demand that calls for the supply of a lot of new valuable specialized resources. 
Because a few researchers across the world are currently working on the systematic study of suffering, but they cannot go further and succeed to a sufficient extent without the help of paid workers and expensive tools that would be an integral part of an Institute. 
A new framework is required 
Clearly, all major spheres of human activity deal in one way or another with suffering: politics, religion, healthcare, social affairs, economics, law, art, literature, philosophy, ethics, the news media, environmental studies, education, science, history, war, crime, work, sport, interpersonal relationships, personal life, etc. Suffering is implicated in other, more specialized fields too, although their overt or ultimate objects of concern are something else. For instance: medicine, social service, social security, insurance, economic development aid, human rights protection, animal welfare, judicial punishment, the practice of torture, disaster relief, Buddhism, certain parts of the biological or psychological or social sciences, etc.

However, the discipline proposed here, which could be called the science of suffering, clearly distinguishes itself from any other approach to suffering because it is concerned specifically, comprehensively and primarily with that subject. That represents a paradigmatic shift that can help every sphere and field to get better results at their action about suffering. Thanks to this particular focus, the science of suffering as a discipline allows us to go beyond three kinds of shortcomings against which other disciplines or any multidisciplinary approach, for all their merits, are powerless when they deal with suffering.
First, the science of suffering is specifically about suffering. Other approaches are inappropriate or inadequate insofar as their specific object of concern is not suffering itself, as such, 'per se'. Only the proposed discipline allows us to acknowledge and deal with the specific reality of suffering in all its guises.
Next, the science of suffering is comprehensively about suffering. Other disciplines are deficient or incomplete insofar as none of them deals in principle with everything that concerns suffering, physical or mental, human or animal. Only a new discipline like the one proposed here embraces within a common conceptual framework all forms of suffering, all causes, all remedies, all elements of the topic. If our goal is to understand and resolve the problems that the existence of suffering entails, these problems must be tackled not only one-by-one, or in more or less narrowly defined contexts, but also in their entirety, in spite of the intimidating scale and complexity that this approach may involve.
Lastly, the science of suffering is primarily about suffering. Other fields of interest are misleading or inconsistent in the sense that when they deal with suffering, they always do so only in relation to their disciplinary (or doctrinal) specialty. Within ethics, for instance, suffering is subordinated to moral considerations, rather than being the very first object of interest. There are countless people or groups who say that their concern is suffering but are focused in reality on concerns which are not suffering as such but rather, for instance, illness or deprivation or injustice. Thus suffering has never hitherto been the particular, comprehensive and first specialty of anybody and therefore, per se, it has been awfully neglected. From the perspective of the science of suffering, all that is not first and foremost focused on the knowledge and/or control of suffering represents a diversion, a deviation from what should be the primary and overriding interest.
Concrete and practical uses
Problems of suffering need concrete and practical solutions. That is why the Institute has the mission to inform everyone about the best solutions available and the new concrete results that can only be reached, like the moon in 1969, with the help of abstract and theoretical knowledge. For instances:
If someone is concerned with a personal problem of suffering, for herself or others, the Institute could help her through a personal reference service such as this Information and Referral Centre that could be expanded to the whole world, and more generally through something like the project Alleviating MY Suffering, which could provide useful orientation on all aspects of personal suffering alleviation (lifestyle, economy, relationships, health, ethics, civil life, etc.).
If a medical or a social service specialist is looking for ways to make his or her work more effective in terms of concrete suffering alleviation, the comprehensive approach of the Institute would allow them to get a contextual map showing theoretical and practical paths that would otherwise remain invisible.
If a decision maker or a policy planner needs to evaluate the pros and cons of an intervention in terms of suffering alleviation, and thus make a dramatic difference in the fate of many individuals, then what, if not the kind of scientific approach that is proposed here, could provide relevant analyses?  
If an investor is made to worry about the serious infliction of suffering involved in the pursuit of a profit, the Institute could provide a technical assessment and propose alternative ways of doing things at an affordable cost. 
If someone has a valuable idea for eradicating a cause of suffering, the Institute might welcome and assist that person by all possible means.
How to bring it about 
Let us form a temporary group of promoters by contacting potentially interested people. First, let us find people across the world who are working a lot on the very topic of suffering per se. There must be between 10 and 30 of those pioneers that can be reached. Let us invite them to support the creation of the Institute, be it by their mere approval of the project or by their full participation as promoters. Secondly, a variety of other people should also be invited to contribute in various ways, including one person who will take care that the public sector is involved in order to avoid a “private business only” bias in the Institute. Thirdly, at least one of the people we need to find is a very wealthy sponsor who would provide an endowment fund, which can currently be estimated at approximately 10 million USD for covering expenses in the first 5 years.

When we are ready, the group of promoters will be replaced by a founding board that will be constituted to finalize a business plan and begin implementing it.

Tentative list of research activities
Bibliography and resource repertories
Developing a library and information service (see also, as an example, The Existential Risk Research Assessment), including bibliographic databases, indexes, abstracts and reviews of documents on all topics, persons, organizations involved in suffering-related activities. This is an essential but very expensive tool that is sorely lacking for those who deal with suffering, whether they are theoreticians, practitioners or from the general public. 
Evaluating documents, and proposing the best of them for further study or implementation in practice.
Providing media monitoring services for those who work on suffering.
Preserving websites or knowledge repositories dealing with suffering, like reducing-suffering.org, hedweb.com, algosphere.org. socrethics.com, etc.
Algometry
Producing maps of endemic or epidemic suffering. Eventually, big data could be used to track suffering.
Producing animated meters showing suffering occurrences (such as www.worldometers.info). 
Producing a daily index (or several indices: daily, weekly, yearly; by geography, by cause etc.) of the impacts of various activities on the alleviation of suffering, based on the stock market index model.
Developing an all-encompassing strategic control panel that would help to see how policies control occurrences of suffering, either in absolute or relative numbers. Also, that may require a “modelization” of suffering, i.e. a theory describing cause-and-effect chains that allow the impact of policies to be predicted and their order of priority to be decided.
R&D planning
Planning projects for alleviating suffering in a fundamental manner, such as ambitious research programs about the basic psychoneural nature of suffering and its technical control through sophisticated hi-tech means, or about the basic social, political or cultural determinants of suffering and their control through large-scale evidence-based policies, or about the alleged Buddhist discovery of the ego illusion as the basic and remediable cause of suffering.
Planning projects for the study of suffering in relation to the prevention or mitigation of global catastrophic risks such as environmental collapse, nuclear war, artificial intelligence ‘singularity’, and other existential risks.
Producing a Study of Suffering Handbook for the general public.
